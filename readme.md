# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using advanced machine learning techniques, with a strong emphasis on model performance, interpretability, and HR applicability. The goal is to help organizations proactively retain talent through actionable insights.

## 🚀 Highlights

- Processed and analyzed **800+ employee records** with 35+ features including job role, income, performance, and satisfaction metrics.
- Identified top attrition drivers like **OverTime**, **JobSatisfaction**, and **MonthlyIncome** through rigorous feature importance and SHAP value analysis.
- Integrated interpretability and transparency to align with ethical AI practices in human resources.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Applied label encoding, missing value handling, feature scaling (StandardScaler), and multicollinearity checks using correlation matrices and VIF.

- **Model Training:**  
  Built and tuned multiple models including:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**  
  - **XGBoost Classifier**  
  Achieved **92% accuracy** and **0.91 F1-score** with 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance.

- **Model Optimization Techniques:**  
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  
  - Balanced class weights for handling class imbalance  
  - ROC-AUC curve and confusion matrix evaluations

## 📊 Model Interpretability

- Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to explain feature contributions at both global and individual prediction levels.
- Generated summary plots, force plots, and dependence plots to visualize how key factors impact attrition likelihood.
- Made the ML model explainable and trustworthy for non-technical stakeholders in HR and management.

## 💡 Business Value

- Offers early warning signals for potential employee exits, enabling **up to 25% reduction in churn risk**.  
- Empowers HR teams to prioritize interventions based on data-driven insights.  
- Promotes responsible AI by ensuring model fairness and transparency.
